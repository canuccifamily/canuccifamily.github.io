		<h3>about us</h3>
		<b>Who are we?</b>
		<p>
			We're the biggest and most powerful family in Free Penguin. We're known as the Canuccis.
		</p>
		<b>When was the family started?</b>
		<p>
			Well, on March 20th, 2017, a well known member (finneysin) got bored with the same old thing everyday. The next day, he decided to stat a mafia roleplay with a friend. It has now escalated to the point of having two families, and possibly more later on.
		</p>
		<b>Join our family</b>
		<p>
			Joining the family is as easy as coming up with a name, and creating a costume. We also ask that you keep your character's name on your playercard. Otherwise, you are free to do whatever. 
		</p>
		<b>I'm not creative. Can you help me with a name? Or maybe a costume?</b>
		<p>
			Not a problem! Trust us, we can pull a few strings. Give our friend Emily some love for creating a great name <a href="http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/italian_names.php">generator.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's a <a href="costume.html">list</a> of items you can use for a costume if you're stuck.
